The creation or sharing of information, ideas, career interests, whistle blowing and
other kinds of expression via virtual communities and networks is made possible by
social media, an interactive computer-mediated technology by remaining as an
anonymous entity.
Our goal is to create an app that would enable you to connect with individuals locally,
regionally, nationally, and even worldwide to offer a platform on which people can
communicate with others globally to discuss ideas and learn about different
cultures throughout the world
